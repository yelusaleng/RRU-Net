# RRU-Net: The Ringed Residual U-Net for Image Splicing Forgery Detection
This repository is for paper ["RRU-Net: The Ringed Residual U-Net for Image Splicing Forgery Detection"](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/html/CV-COPS/Bi_RRU-Net_The_Ringed_Residual_U-Net_for_Image_Splicing_Forgery_Detection_CVPRW_2019_paper.html) (CVPR 2019 workshop)

## Update (2022.7.9)
The uploaded model 'best_model' is trained new datasets generated by my new work "Image splicing forgery detection by combining synthetic adversarial networks and hybrid dense U‐net based on multiple spaces".
Actually, the new work is completed two years ago, but it is accepted until recently.
TODO:
- I will upload the whole project of my new work, it contains a new approach to generate splicing forgery image.

------

## Update (2020.12.15)
Upload the pre-trained model. <br>
NOTICING: 
- the uploaded pre-trained model is trained with new datasets since i lost previous pre-trained model.
- the new dataset is produced by my new work, so i can't release it currently.

------

## Requirements
- Python 3.7
- PyTorch 1.0+ 
- CUDA 10.0+

## Details
 - './unet/unet-parts.py': it includes detailed implementations of 'U-Net', 'RU-Net' and 'RRU-Net'
 - 'train.py': you can use it to train your model
 - 'predict.py': you can use it to test
